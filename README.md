## üîπ Vision

**BasedButton** was created to explore one question:  
‚ÄúHow simple can a dApp be ‚Äî and still feel magical?‚Äù

This project is a tribute to **clarity and curiosity** in Web3 design.  
A single button, a single interaction, and a full blockchain experience.  

No backend. No dependencies. No noise.  
Just you, your wallet, and Base.
